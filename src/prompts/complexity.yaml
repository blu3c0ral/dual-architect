breakdown_prompt: |
  I have a software development task with the following requirements:
        
  ```
  {requirements}
  ```
  
  The complexity of this task has been estimated at {complexity}/10, which exceeds
  our maximum allowed complexity of {max_complexity}/10.
  
  Please suggest how to break this down into TWO SEPARATE STAGES that could be
  implemented sequentially, where each stage would be simpler than the original task.
  
  For each suggested stage:
  1. Provide a clear name/title
  2. List the specific requirements for that stage
  3. Explain how this breakdown reduces complexity
  4. Suggest a rough complexity estimate for each stage
  
  Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
  {{
      "stage1": {{
          "name": "Stage 1 name",
          "requirements": "Detailed requirements for stage 1",
          "complexity_estimate": X,
          "reasoning": "Why this stage is simpler"
      }},
      "stage2": {{
          "name": "Stage 2 name",
          "requirements": "Detailed requirements for stage 2",
          "complexity_estimate": Y,
          "reasoning": "Why this stage is simpler"
      }},
      "explanation": "Overall explanation of the breakdown strategy"
  }}
